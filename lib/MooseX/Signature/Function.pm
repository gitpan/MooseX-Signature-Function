=head1 NAME 

MooseX::Signature::Function - A framework for function signatures in Moose

=head1 WARNING

As the version number should indicate, this is a developer release and
is subject to change at any time. It is put on CPAN so that people may
experiment with it and provide feedback but is not intended to be used
in production quite yet. You have been warned.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a framework for function signatures in Moose. A 
signature is (For the purpose of this module) a specification of what
parameters functions and methods should accept. This module isn't
intended for direct use, but rather as backend to any number of modules
that needs this functionality, such as L<MooseX::Method> which will
eventually be converted to use this.

This being a developer release, the API used to working with
signatures is subject to change. My goal is that when this module gets
out of developer status, the API will remains backwards compatible in
any future release.
